## 1. Introduction

The _Component_ dealt with in the current document is called
**_Phingers Component_**. It is in charge of the capture of the user's fingerprints and the subsequent
fingerprints and the subsequent extraction of the subsequent fingerprint templates.
extraction of the subsequent fingerprint templates. Its main functionalities are
functionalities are as follows:

- Two modes of operation: extraction of the four fingers of the hand (except for the thumb), or
  (except the thumb), or extraction of the thumb only.

- Internal camera management.

- Permission management.

- Built-in vividness detection.

- Assistant in fingerprint capture processes.

- Generation of templates with fingerprint characteristics,
  images and scores.

### 1.1 Minimum requirements

The minimum iOS SDK version required is as follows:

- Minimum iOS version: **13**

## 2. Integration of the component

Before integrating this component, it is recommended that you read the documentation
documentation for the **<u>Core Component</u>** and follow the instructions
indicated in this document.

This section will explain step by step how to integrate the current component into an existing project.

install the component in a project containing an old version of the Facephi libraries.

### 2.2 Permissions and settings

In the client application where the components are going to be integrated, it is necessary to incorporate the following elements in the file **info.plist**.

## 4. Component configuration

To configure the current component, once it has been initialised, you need to
create a _PhingersConfigurationData_ object and pass it as a parameter to the
SDKController during the component launch.

The following section will show the fields that are part of this class and what each one is used for.

## 5. Use of the component

Once the component has been started and a new operation has been created (**paragraph
3**) the SDK components can be launched. There are two ways to launch
the component:

- **[NO TRACKING]** This call allows you to launch the component's functionality as normal, but **[NO TRACKING]** This call allows you to launch the component's functionality as normal.
  functionality of the component normally, but **no event will be tracked** to the _tracking_ server.
  event to the _tracking_ server:

```java
let controller = PhingersController(data: phingersConfigurationData, output: output, viewController: viewController)
SDKController.shared.launch(controller: controller)
```

- **[WITH TRACKING]** This call allows the component's functionality to be launched as normal.
  functionality of the component normally, but internal events will be tracked to the _tracking_ server.
  events to the _tracking_ server:

```java
let controller = PhingersController(data: phingersConfigurationData, output: output, viewController: viewController)
SDKController.shared.launchMethod(controller: controller)
```
The **launch** method must be used **by default**. This method allows

when it is deactivated (or the component is not installed).

On the other hand, the **launchMethod** method covers a special case, in which the
where the integrator has tracking installed and activated, but in a given flow within the application does not want to use it when it is deactivated.
flow within the application does not want to track information.
In that case this method is used to avoid sending that information to the
to the platform.

### 6.1 Content of the _data_ field

The result returns the images in **Bitmap** format, it is possible to

The _data_ field is variable and will depend on which component the result was returned.
the result has been returned. In the case of this component, the returned fields are
the following:

#### 6.1.1 _focusQuality_.

Returns the best image extracted from the authentication process in
Base64 string format. This image is the original size image
extracted from the camera. Valid for the **liveness** process.

## 7. Component customisation

Apart from the changes that can be made at the SDK level (which are explained in the **Core Component** document), the

### 7.1 Texts

If you want to modify the SDK texts you would have to include the following XML file in the client application

```java
<!-- PHINGERS -->
