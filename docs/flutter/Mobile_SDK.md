# Getting Started

## 1. Introduction

**SDK Mobile** is a set of libraries (**_Components_**) that offer a
series of functionalities and services, allowing their integration into
a Mobile application in a simple and totally scalable way. Certain
components must be installed depending on the use case required. Its
high level of modularity allows other new components to be added in the
future without affecting those already integrated into the project.
